    <h2>About Jennifer</h2>

    <p>I’ve spent more than two decades in the real estate and new home industry, building a career rooted in strategy, sales excellence, and leadership.</p>

    <p>I began my career with Prudential New Homes, working closely with executive leadership and supporting the company through its merger with The Ryness Company in 2001. That early exposure to high-level operations and growth strategy shaped the foundation of my career. In 2004, I transitioned into frontline new home sales, and in 2006 I was honored as the NAHB Rookie Salesperson of the Year.</p>

    <p>In 2008, I moved into the distressed and investment space, working with REDC Home Auctions and Red Crown Realty, where I specialized in listing bank-owned properties and worked directly with institutional asset managers. This chapter sharpened my expertise in pricing strategy, market analytics, and high-stakes negotiation.</p>

    <p>I later joined RE/MAX, where I continued to expand my practice while earning my California Broker’s License in 2011. Over the years, my experience has spanned condo conversions, mid-rise developments, new home communities, and residential resale. I’m known for my ability to analyze pricing with precision, navigate complex negotiations, and create strategies that move product—even in challenging markets.</p>

    <p>In addition to my professional work, I’ve been deeply involved in industry leadership. I’ve served on the Greater Sales & Marketing Council (GSMC)—a council of the Building Industry Association of Southern California (BIASC)—for the past six years as a Board Member, including three years on the Executive Board. I currently serve as Vice President and am honored to be slated to act as President for the 2027 term. Supporting, elevating, and advancing the new home industry remains a core passion of mine.</p>

    <p>I hold a Bachelor of Science in Business Management from Pepperdine University’s Graziadio School of Business, am a Certified Sales Professional, and have been a licensed California Real Estate Broker since 2011. I was also recognized as a RE/MAX 100% Club member for three consecutive years.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I’m based in Los Angeles County with my husband, our three children, and our doodle, Buzz. Much of my free time is spent cheering on kids’ sports at a competitive level—baseball, basketball, water polo, and soccer—or pushing myself physically. I’ve completed two Spartan Beast races, two half marathons, and a Ragnar Trail race in Perris, California.</p>

    <p>I’m deeply passionate about the new home industry and excited about what’s next.</p>
